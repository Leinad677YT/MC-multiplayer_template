## Serverside

> [!NOTE]
> I tried to boil at 1000 kelvin these spaghettis to see if they got better, because of this, the join functions will return an error if the target team didn't exist. And any of them won't call their respective function call if they didn't need to execute that part (no team gets created, left or changed)

## Player individual team

Using `update_team` will update the prefixes, suffixes, color... of the `$(name)` player team, whatever you specify in those functions.
