# CORE MODULE

### Content

This pack controls how the entities are processed, **it expands the core manager** as it gets a direct call from inside
> - **call events** > _`l.user/tags/function/new_entity/`_

> [!NOTE]
> **AS OF NOW, THE on_entity_spawn EVENT GETS CALLED FOR ALL ENTITIES OUTSIDE THE ENTITY TAG #l.core:_no_ai**


> [!WARNING]
> This module **may** be changed in the near future, but general behaviour/calls will remain
