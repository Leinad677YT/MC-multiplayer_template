The spawnpoint functions are meant to be used when you save spawnpoints on the gamemode, if you don't want to do that, regular `/spawnpoint` is fine
> ![NOTE]
> Remember that to disable spawnpoint saving you need to tag the players with `l.inventory.not_save_spawn`

> ![WARNING]
> `set_pos` will overwrite the saved position, if you don't want to do this, use regular `/tp`
